<i>Previously on Pretty Little Liars....</i>

2
00:00:02,797 --> 00:00:04,165
What happened in the woods?

3
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:05,600
Toby Cavanaugh is dead.

4
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:08,569
Somebody killed him. I saw his body.

5
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,037
Ahh! Oh, God.

6
00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:11,771
Maggie, I am so sorry.

7
00:00:11,772 --> 00:00:13,906
Did pastor Ted hire somebody
to work on the church?

8
00:00:13,907 --> 00:00:15,808
Hannah: I put a five dollar bill
in the church collection box,

9
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,511
it had some dice drawn on it.

10
00:00:17,512 --> 00:00:19,179
And later that day, Caleb's dad had it.

11
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,480
Do you really think he
would steal from the place

12
00:00:20,481 --> 00:00:21,648
that just hired him?

13
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:23,650
There was some trouble with the old badges.

14
00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:25,785
People getting in? People getting out?

15
00:00:25,786 --> 00:00:28,254
Ezra Fitz has applied
as a substitute teacher.

16
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:31,124
I have to ask, are you seeing Ezra Fitz?

17
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:31,991
No, I'm not.

18
00:00:34,194 --> 00:00:36,595
All I want from you and
your mother is that car.

19
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:39,165
Look at all that's happened
since you turned me down

20
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,300
on our little drive up the mountain.

21
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:43,835
But I believe in second
chances. You need me.

22
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:49,808
(Door buzzing)

23
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,782
You have visitors.

24
00:00:56,783 --> 00:00:58,383
Spencer?

25
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,385
I'll be in the hall if you need me.

26
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:14,131
Emily: Hey. You knew we were coming, right?

27
00:01:14,132 --> 00:01:17,000
We spoke with your mom. We
wanted to be here the first day.

28
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:19,035
But she said you were going
to be home tomorrow, so...

29
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:20,536
She still believes that?

30
00:01:22,073 --> 00:01:23,707
She thinks that I'll be able
to sleep through the night

31
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:27,443
if I just take a nice bubble
bath and lay in my own bed?

32
00:01:28,913 --> 00:01:32,181
- I think what she wants is...
- I know what she wants, but

33
00:01:32,182 --> 00:01:35,184
they don't make a loofa that
scrapes out the inside of your head.

34
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:42,357
The park rangers found a body.

35
00:01:42,358 --> 00:01:44,026
Emily and Aria: Hannah! What?

36
00:01:44,027 --> 00:01:46,228
The sooner she knows, the sooner
she checks out of this place.

37
00:01:47,996 --> 00:01:52,266
What Hannah is trying to
say is we have good news.

38
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:54,769
They found a body in the woods.

39
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,871
The police believe it was a camper.

40
00:01:57,973 --> 00:02:00,174
It was Toby.

41
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:04,377
No, Spence, it wasn't.

42
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:06,913
This person, he'd been missing for awhile

43
00:02:06,914 --> 00:02:08,749
and he was nowhere near
where you thought you saw...

44
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,917
I know what I saw.

45
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:12,719
It was Toby.

46
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:20,960
Hey, so, um, I was thinking tomorrow night

47
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:22,628
when you get home, we could all...

48
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:24,830
I need to stay here. I need more time.

49
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:26,198
Time for what?

50
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,432
Hannah.

51
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:28,801
Shuffling around in Mona's old slippers

52
00:02:28,802 --> 00:02:30,269
isn't going to get her any better.

53
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,237
Hannah, chill.

54
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:32,304
You know what...

55
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:34,106
I would not dine here, if I were you,

56
00:02:34,107 --> 00:02:35,907
I had to sneak around in that kitchen,

57
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:38,276
and I saw a roach big
enough to wear an apron.

58
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:39,911
Moving. On.

59
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:42,680
You are not crazy. This place is.

60
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:45,283
I'm too tired to have
this fight right now, guys.

61
00:02:49,655 --> 00:02:51,789
I feel safe here.

62
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,825
Those bars don't just
keep you from getting out,

63
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:57,694
they keep other people from getting in.

64
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:11,774
(Knocking on door) Uh, need a minute.

65
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,813
Your friends are leaving.
Do you want to say good-bye?

66
00:03:16,814 --> 00:03:18,080
I already did.

67
00:03:33,863 --> 00:03:35,797

00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,266

76
00:03:56,683 --> 00:03:58,017
Hannah: Have you seen my make-up bag?

77
00:03:58,018 --> 00:03:59,485
(Sighs) No, but I think everything

78
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:00,920
that was in it is on my pillow.

79
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:02,889
Okay, don't start. I only slept for,

80
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,257
like, 20 minutes.

81
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:05,291
Emily: Why do you keep looking out there?

82
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:07,327
Because Wilden knows I'm staying here.

83
00:04:07,328 --> 00:04:08,828
That's what you're thinking about?

84
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:10,396
I'm having dreams about our
friend having her head shaved,

85
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:11,663
and you're looking...

86
00:04:11,664 --> 00:04:12,697
I have lots of other
things that are keeping me

87
00:04:12,698 --> 00:04:14,499
up at night, okay Emily?

88
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,069
If that car I dunked suddenly
learns how to float, then...

89
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,070
If Wilden's looking for his car,

90
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:19,271
then he's not "A."

91
00:04:19,272 --> 00:04:21,073
Okay, besides cars
don't float, if they did,

92
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:22,174
pilgrims could have driven here.

93
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:23,608
Why is there a wet towel on my bed?

94
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:24,642
(Knock on door)

95
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:25,978
Pam: Ladies, you better get hopping,

96
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,478
or you're not going to
have time for breakfast.

97
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,248
Hannah: Oh, none for me, thanks.

98
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:32,583
You know I love her, but
somebody's got to teach

99
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:35,519
that girl the word "fold."

100
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,988
It was a rough night.

101
00:04:36,989 --> 00:04:39,490
Honey, look. I know it's
hard seeing a friend suffer,

102
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:41,058
but if the doctors think she...

103
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:42,693
Doctors aren't helping Spencer.

104
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:44,494
Okay, she still believes that was Toby.

105
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:46,562
Well, you can't get caught
up in that kind of thinking.

106
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:48,698
Don't take on a tragedy that
has nothing to do with you.

107
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:50,733
Mom! Okay, you work at the precinct,

108
00:04:50,734 --> 00:04:52,769
can you at least tell me when
you know more about the body?

109
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,338
(Sighs) Look,

110
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:58,275
if it'll help you move on from this,

111
00:04:58,276 --> 00:05:00,376
then yes.

112
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:03,212
You'll know when I know.

113
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:13,755
Sure if this is big enough to split?

114
00:05:13,756 --> 00:05:16,791
I think that we should go sit inside.

115
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:17,926
We could also eat this in my car

116
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:19,693
and duck every time somebody walks by.

117
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,262
If I'm telling the principal
that we're not involved,

118
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:22,964
I don't think we should be seen splitting

119
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:24,665
- a cruller on the sidewalk.
- All right,

120
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,100
we're not going backwards.

121
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:27,535
We'll figure it out.

122
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,338
Look...

123
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:32,740
Nothing between us needs to change.

124
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:34,909
(Phone ringing)

125
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:37,511
It's Maggie.

126
00:05:39,347 --> 00:05:41,315
Hey, what's up?

127
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:43,150
What time?

128
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,355
Tomorrow... um, no, I just have a...

129
00:05:49,356 --> 00:05:55,294
You know what, yeah. I can pick him up.

130
00:05:55,295 --> 00:05:56,930
Yep.

131
00:05:56,931 --> 00:05:58,197
What's going on?

132
00:05:58,198 --> 00:05:59,966
Malcolm's karate class
gets out at the same time

133
00:05:59,967 --> 00:06:02,836
as my second interview.

134
00:06:02,837 --> 00:06:06,772
Well, I'd offer to help, I just figured

135
00:06:06,773 --> 00:06:09,007
after the whole
falling-off-the-bed incident...

136
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:11,009
Well, you know I don't blame you for that.

137
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,779
It's not about me.

138
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,981
- So, Maggie blames me.
- You know what,

139
00:06:15,982 --> 00:06:18,283
honestly, I would love it
if you picked up Malcolm.

140
00:06:18,284 --> 00:06:20,085
If I put off this interview,

141
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:22,153
someone else is going to get that job.

142
00:06:22,154 --> 00:06:23,254
(Laughs)

143
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:25,156
Well, what are you going to tell Maggie?

144
00:06:25,157 --> 00:06:27,192
I can deal with her.

145
00:06:30,096 --> 00:06:32,230
And what's even trippier
is we both have scars

146
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:34,499
below our left knee.
And, you know, granted,

147
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,201
my dad got his in prison, but...

148
00:06:37,202 --> 00:06:38,635
That was a joke.

149
00:06:38,636 --> 00:06:40,137
(Laughs)

150
00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:44,475
Mmm, what's that smell? New perfume?

151
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:46,410
No, it's air freshener.

152
00:06:46,411 --> 00:06:48,412
Emily's mom sprayed it all
over my clothes and then,

153
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:51,215
when I wasn't looking,
she sprayed it in my hair.

154
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:52,415
Ask her to spritz you tonight.

155
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,850
My dad wants to take us to a nice dinner.

156
00:06:54,851 --> 00:06:58,654
Caleb, he does not have to do that.

157
00:06:58,655 --> 00:07:01,391
Stop.

158
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:02,892
Look, not only are you the person that

159
00:07:02,893 --> 00:07:05,428
brought him back into my life,

160
00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:07,563
but you're the reason
he gets to stay in it.

161
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:11,233
And you got the man work.

162
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:13,002
Let him get you an entrée.

163
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:33,220
Can't you just ask your mom for
a copy of the coroner's report?

164
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:34,789
Aria, the report doesn't say not Toby,

165
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,257
it says John Doe.

166
00:07:36,258 --> 00:07:38,826
It's not going to change Spencer's mind.

167
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:41,428
(Phone rings)

168
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,032
Who's that?

169
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:46,667
Um, Shana.

170
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:48,835
Why does she keep texting you
while Paige is out of town?

171
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:49,870
Is she into you?

172
00:07:51,105 --> 00:07:53,273
Sorry you guys, Caleb had a lot to share.

173
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:54,274
Why are you blushing?

174
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:55,976
Why is she blushing?

175
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:58,277
Shana's cruising her, and I
think that she should shut it down

176
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,946
<i>before it turns into ex and the city.</i>

177
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:01,781
Guys, I'm not thinking about Shana.

178
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:03,182
We need to help Spencer.

179
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,816
No, Em, you saw her face.

180
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,351
She's not getting out of
there unless we kidnap her.

181
00:08:07,352 --> 00:08:10,288
Or we actually take the body there
and prove to her it isn't Toby.

182
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,259
Em, that's not a real option.

183
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,429
No, but, taking a picture of it is.

184
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,898
And we've been to that morgue before,

185
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,032
what's stopping us from going back?

186
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:25,469
Um, do we really have to answer that?

187
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:30,007
Eddie: Ever played this one?

188
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:34,211
Um, no. Looks like it's
a bit before my time.

189
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,013
So is Duke Ellington.
If he walks in the door,

190
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:38,280
are you going to ask him
not to play the piano?

191
00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:40,783
Wren: Spencer? I just
learned you're admitted.

192
00:08:40,784 --> 00:08:42,719
I didn't know.

193
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,021
Eddie, uh, could you check on Mr. Paterson?

194
00:08:45,022 --> 00:08:47,156
He may need assistance
getting to physical therapy.

195
00:08:47,157 --> 00:08:48,424
He had it this morning.

196
00:08:48,425 --> 00:08:49,692
Then, perhaps you could do a follow-up,

197
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:51,293
check on his pain management.

198
00:09:01,104 --> 00:09:02,804
How're you feeling?

199
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:03,972
Um...

200
00:09:06,976 --> 00:09:09,610
Spencer, if there's anything
I said or did that...

201
00:09:09,611 --> 00:09:11,712
No, you're not the reason that I'm here.

202
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:15,716
Who chose this game? You or Eddie?

203
00:09:15,717 --> 00:09:16,851
Eddie. Why?

204
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,822
He played it with Mona,
when she first arrived.

205
00:09:21,823 --> 00:09:23,323
Yeah, she was a bit obsessed with it,

206
00:09:23,324 --> 00:09:25,859
until she eventually traded it for cards.

207
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,728
(Phone ringing)

208
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:30,063
I'm afraid I've got to push on.

209
00:09:30,064 --> 00:09:31,665
I'll check on you later.

210
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:35,401
Okay.

211
00:09:51,818 --> 00:09:53,118
I'll see you later.

212
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:54,053
Hannah?

213
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:58,690
I've left your mom several
messages and I haven't heard back.

214
00:09:58,691 --> 00:10:01,492
Is there a better way that I can reach her?

215
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:03,961
Uh, she's in New York right
now for a training seminar.

216
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:06,731
Why, what's wrong?

217
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:10,768
We just need her to weigh
in on a delicate issue.

218
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:12,003
Who's we?

219
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,908
Mrs. Montgomery, what's going on?

220
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,676
(Sighs)

221
00:10:19,677 --> 00:10:21,812
I'm on the church's restoration committee,

222
00:10:21,813 --> 00:10:23,747
and something's come up.

223
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,049
Wait, is this about Caleb's dad?

224
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,751
(Sighs)

225
00:10:28,752 --> 00:10:31,854
How well did your mom know
Jamie before she recommended him?

226
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,825
Look, I'm trying to help.

227
00:10:35,826 --> 00:10:37,492
It's just, it's really
hard to defend the honor

228
00:10:37,493 --> 00:10:39,228
of someone you don't even know.

229
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:42,732
I'm hoping it's all just
a big misunderstanding.

230
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:44,566
And what's the misunderstanding?

231
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:50,004
Jamie... removed the
bronze bell from the tower

232
00:10:50,005 --> 00:10:52,240
to have it repaired, but the one that was

233
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:56,244
returned is evidently of much lesser value.

234
00:10:56,245 --> 00:10:58,312
Wait, that's what this is about?

235
00:10:58,313 --> 00:11:00,648
They miss their old, crusty bell?

236
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:03,450
To the tune of $8,000.

237
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:06,854
Please, don't say anything to Caleb,

238
00:11:06,855 --> 00:11:09,422
just have your mom call me.

239
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:39,716
It's got great bones.

240
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,484
They built these churches to last.

241
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:43,486
When do they expect you to be done?

242
00:12:43,487 --> 00:12:45,021
I'm going to take my time.

243
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:46,622
I want to get this right.

244
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:51,160
Oh, before I forget.

245
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,801
What is this?

246
00:12:58,802 --> 00:12:59,702
It's for you.

247
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,470
Open it.

248
00:13:06,842 --> 00:13:07,842
It's an angel.

249
00:13:07,843 --> 00:13:09,210
It seemed appropriate.

250
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,047
I don't know what to say.

251
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:13,414
(Phone ringing)

252
00:13:13,415 --> 00:13:16,084
Oh, I hate these damn things.

253
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:17,718
Let me turn this off.

254
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:22,723
Actually, it's Pastor Ted.

255
00:13:22,724 --> 00:13:24,191
I may have to get this, excuse me.

256
00:13:26,895 --> 00:13:28,062
Hello?

257
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:33,499
Veronica: I thought this
might make you feel better.

258
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,001
And then maybe on the
way home, we can stop...

259
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:38,404
- I'm not coming home. 
- Just at least put on the blouse.

260
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:41,474
Mom, I told you I'm not ready.

261
00:13:41,475 --> 00:13:43,409
Well, as soon as you're
in your own bedroom,

262
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,543
- surrounded by your... 
- Look, mom,

263
00:13:44,544 --> 00:13:46,980
I can't just go back
to dinners at the club.

264
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:48,947
You don't have to wear the
blazer, just put on the...

265
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:50,248
(Yelling) I said I'm not ready!

266
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:17,207
What happened between you and Toby?

267
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:24,313
I'm not moving from this spot
until I get a real answer.

268
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:30,485
The last time I saw someone in this state,

269
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:32,955
clinging to a secret
this hard, it was Alison.

270
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:37,860
A few weeks later she was dead.

271
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,699
(Door opens)

272
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,968
(Sighs) Alison.

273
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:50,237
Where were you? I thought you were

274
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:51,338
asleep in Spencer's room.

275
00:14:52,574 --> 00:14:55,242
I had to go out.

276
00:14:55,243 --> 00:14:56,243
For what?

277
00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:00,714
What happened to your mouth? It's bleeding.

278
00:15:00,715 --> 00:15:04,184
I must've scratched myself on a tree branch

279
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:05,952
on my way over to the house.

280
00:15:05,953 --> 00:15:08,088
Can I go upstairs, please?

281
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:10,223
Why did you have to go to your
house at three in the morning?

282
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:14,227
Mrs. Hastings, please.
I can't talk about this.

283
00:15:14,228 --> 00:15:16,696
Let me get some ice for
your mouth. Just stay there.

284
00:15:16,697 --> 00:15:18,097
Please?

285
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:25,470
Here.

286
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,675
Did you have a fight with someone?

287
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:33,144
Mrs. Hastings, if you tell my parents,

288
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:34,446
it's only going to make it worse.

289
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:38,917
Promise me you won't say anything.

290
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:45,123
Come here.

291
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:51,529
Shh.

292
00:15:54,566 --> 00:15:56,300
I'm just being weird.

293
00:15:57,902 --> 00:16:00,738
Overly sensitive. I'm fine.

294
00:16:08,212 --> 00:16:10,413
You never told this to the police?

295
00:16:10,414 --> 00:16:11,948
Of course I did.

296
00:16:14,885 --> 00:16:17,520
But I made up my own mind about
who went after her that night

297
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:19,188
and I kept that to myself.

298
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:20,356
Well, who?

299
00:16:20,357 --> 00:16:22,725
Why? Mom, how could you not say anything?

300
00:16:22,726 --> 00:16:24,793
Because if Jason went after us,

301
00:16:24,794 --> 00:16:27,829
exposing your father as his, too,

302
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,566
it'd be my family breaking
down in the middle of the night.

303
00:16:33,303 --> 00:16:35,471
So, you still believe Jason?

304
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:37,739
No, I don't. Not anymore.

305
00:16:38,907 --> 00:16:41,142
But I'm starting to wonder about others.

306
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,581
I need to ask.

307
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:51,486
Is Toby not the person
that we thought he was?

308
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,600
Sorry, guys, I'm going
to have to hit the road.

309
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:08,768
There's a problem at
work I gotta deal with.

310
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:09,769
What, right now?

311
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,937
I've just been fired.

312
00:17:11,938 --> 00:17:14,006
What... what are you talking about?

313
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:17,910
It seems the wrong bell
got hung up in the tower...

314
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,979
I'm gonna have to go down to the
foundry myself and clear this up.

315
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,247
Do you want me to come with you?

316
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:24,216
No, you guys finish your dinner,

317
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:26,584
I'll sort this out. I'll see you later.

318
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,826
(Door closing)

319
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:11,894
Okay, who am I supposed
to text if I see someone?

320
00:18:11,895 --> 00:18:13,362
Me. Not Hannah.

321
00:18:13,363 --> 00:18:15,664
We're using her phone to take the picture.

322
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:17,532
Hannah, pay attention.

323
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:19,835
What? I'm sorry.

324
00:18:19,836 --> 00:18:22,303
My boyfriend's dad got nailed for stealing.

325
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:24,539
Where do you sell a hot bell, anyway?

326
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,507
Hannah, focus. I don't want to be

327
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:27,175
in there any longer than we have to.

328
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:30,210
We find John Doe, we take the
picture, and we get out of here.

329
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:32,312
If it's bronze, you
probably melt it down first.

330
00:18:32,313 --> 00:18:33,781
Melt it into what?

331
00:18:33,782 --> 00:18:35,115
Why are we still discussing bells?

332
00:18:35,116 --> 00:18:37,585
Because Caleb thinks his dad is a Saint,

333
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:40,120
and I know he's selling
pieces of our church online.

334
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:41,722
Okay, forget it. I'll do this alone.

335
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:55,234
Hannah: How are we gonna
know which one is John Doe?

336
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,870
Emily: We have to go through those racks.

337
00:18:56,871 --> 00:18:59,472
Um, no. You are going through those racks.

338
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:02,674
This isn't a clearance sale,
Emily, and I'm freaking out.

339
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,143
All we've done is walk through those doors.

340
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:07,313
It doesn't matter! I smell dead people.

341
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:12,318
Fine, just get your phone ready, okay?

342
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,222
I'll hold it, but you have to aim it.

343
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,857
I just want to close my eyes.

344
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,838
Hannah: God, this is so wrong.

345
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:36,140
You spend your whole life doing crunches,

346
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:41,211
getting rid of tan lines, not
eating that second pudding.

347
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,582
And then in the end you're
just a stale loaf of bread

348
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,451
lying on a rack.

349
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,885
Um, maybe you can help me with this loaf,

350
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,519
- I can't find the tag.
- Wait.

351
00:19:51,288 --> 00:19:53,056
Em, what if it really is Toby in there?

352
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:57,160
It's not. And Spencer needs to know that.

353
00:19:58,563 --> 00:19:59,863
Okay, but just in case
I don't know if I can

354
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:02,766
handle seeing his face.
So can we just look for

355
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:05,468
his tattoo or something?

356
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:06,769
It's not Toby.

357
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,280
(Cell phone beeps)

358
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,721
(Door closes)

359
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:32,660
(Elevator bell dings)

360
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:43,036
Emily: Ahh!

361
00:20:49,443 --> 00:20:51,845
(Cell phone rings)

362
00:20:51,846 --> 00:20:53,079
Em, someone's coming.

363
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,113
Come on, we have to go.

364
00:20:55,415 --> 00:20:57,149
Em, come on!

365
00:21:05,205 --> 00:21:06,639
(Knocking on door)

366
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,873
Hi, sunshine.

367
00:21:07,874 --> 00:21:09,774
Hey.

368
00:21:09,775 --> 00:21:11,443
Good book?

369
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:12,911
It's okay.

370
00:21:12,912 --> 00:21:15,647
Can I ask you something?

371
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:18,350
That game that you
wanted to play yesterday?

372
00:21:18,351 --> 00:21:21,386
I heard it was one of Mona's favorites.

373
00:21:21,387 --> 00:21:23,655
Who played it with her?

374
00:21:23,656 --> 00:21:25,156
I don't recall.

375
00:21:25,157 --> 00:21:27,358
Mona liked to play a lot of games.

376
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,859
Yeah, but Wren...

377
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,162
Dr. Kingston, he said she was

378
00:21:31,163 --> 00:21:32,463
"obsessed" with this one.

379
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:34,798
Well, he would know.

380
00:21:36,134 --> 00:21:37,768
What is with you and him?

381
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:40,971
What do you mean?

382
00:21:40,972 --> 00:21:45,775
Eddie, are you the
person behind the trouble

383
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:47,443
with the visitors' passes?

384
00:21:47,444 --> 00:21:48,978
Did you let somebody in who...

385
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:51,447
It wasn't me.

386
00:21:51,448 --> 00:21:52,614
Was it Dr. Kingston?

387
00:21:55,051 --> 00:21:56,852
Take your pill.

388
00:21:56,853 --> 00:21:57,953
You may be sleeping, but you don't look

389
00:21:57,954 --> 00:21:59,021
like you're getting any rest.

390
00:21:59,022 --> 00:22:00,489
I won't tell anybody.

391
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,825
Trust your instinct. Mine told me,

392
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:06,294
from the minute that guy got here,

393
00:22:06,295 --> 00:22:07,661
it wasn't for the right reasons.

394
00:22:09,631 --> 00:22:11,499
Let's just leave it at that, okay?

395
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,055
Hey.

396
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,789
Did you get my messages?

397
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,124
Yeah, I've been cramming for algebra.

398
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,060
I have a make-up test
in, like, ten minutes.

399
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,694
Well, my dad's screwed.

400
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:19,496
The foundry claims there is no mix-up,

401
00:23:19,497 --> 00:23:21,765
and they have the paper trail to prove it.

402
00:23:21,766 --> 00:23:23,999
Well, maybe if your father
spoke to the church committee,

403
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,335
and told them that... told them what?

404
00:23:26,336 --> 00:23:28,071
Why should he have to
defend himself to a bunch of

405
00:23:28,072 --> 00:23:30,273
small-minded people who
think someone is a thief

406
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:32,175
just because they don't
tuck in their shirt?

407
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:37,447
Did I press mute or something?

408
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:38,447
Why are you being so quiet?

409
00:23:39,515 --> 00:23:41,683
I'm just listening.

410
00:23:41,684 --> 00:23:43,418
You did a lot of that last night, too.

411
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:48,223
I don't know what to say, Caleb.

412
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,692
Since when? Hannah you
have an opinion about

413
00:23:50,693 --> 00:23:52,894
everything, from honey boo-boo's hair cut

414
00:23:52,895 --> 00:23:55,196
to the weird look the
lunch lady gave you when

415
00:23:55,197 --> 00:23:56,897
you asked for butter on your corn.

416
00:23:56,898 --> 00:23:58,732
Look, I just don't think that

417
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:00,568
your dad has changed as much

418
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,203
as much as you think he has.

419
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:09,876
Look, the night that he
got the job at the church,

420
00:24:09,877 --> 00:24:12,745
I put money in the church collection box,

421
00:24:12,746 --> 00:24:16,716
and when he paid for the
pizza, he used that same bill.

422
00:24:18,685 --> 00:24:20,253
How could you possibly know that?

423
00:24:20,254 --> 00:24:24,257
Because there was a pair
of lucky dice drawn on it.

424
00:24:24,258 --> 00:24:25,725
It was the same bill, Caleb.

425
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,697
(School bell rings)

426
00:24:36,002 --> 00:24:38,837
(Scattered chattering)

427
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:45,876
Hi. Excuse me, yeah, I'm
here to pick up Malcolm.

428
00:24:45,877 --> 00:24:48,312
Oh, he was already picked
up about ten minutes ago.

429
00:24:48,313 --> 00:24:50,881
He was? Oh, so Maggie must have...

430
00:24:50,882 --> 00:24:53,151
Oh, no, his mom didn't
come today, it was a friend.

431
00:24:53,152 --> 00:24:55,586
Uh, Aria Montgomery.

432
00:24:57,322 --> 00:24:58,788
Something wrong?

433
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,491
No. No, everything's fine, thanks.

434
00:25:17,274 --> 00:25:19,941
(Carnival music playing)

435
00:25:19,942 --> 00:25:21,877
(Children laughing)

436
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:27,216
(Laughing)

437
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:46,311
Carnival barker: Knock
them down and win a prize!

438
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:48,880
(Carnival barker continues)

439
00:25:55,786 --> 00:25:57,621
(Laughter)

440
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,689
Ella: Aria?

441
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,892
I didn't know you were coming here tonight.

442
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,594
Yeah, I'm came to meet
up with Ezra and Malcolm.

443
00:26:04,595 --> 00:26:06,296
Are you all right?

444
00:26:06,297 --> 00:26:08,197
Is Maggie here, too?

445
00:26:08,198 --> 00:26:09,132
I don't know, maybe.

446
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:10,433
Honey, we talked about this.

447
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:12,435
And I know you want to make it work, but...

448
00:26:12,436 --> 00:26:15,038
- Okay, mom, I can't do this right now.
- Aria!

449
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,906
You're going to be the one that gets hurt.

450
00:26:16,907 --> 00:26:19,575
Not to mention a confused
little boy who's still wondering

451
00:26:19,576 --> 00:26:21,977
how this stranger is suddenly his father.

452
00:26:21,978 --> 00:26:24,746
He needs help working
through it, but not with you.

453
00:26:24,747 --> 00:26:27,449
Malcolm already has
somebody looking out for him.

454
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,684
I have to go.

455
00:26:48,903 --> 00:26:52,039
Be right back, I'm going to
drop this off to room 217.

456
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,975
What is that?

457
00:26:54,976 --> 00:26:56,310
A book.

458
00:26:56,311 --> 00:26:58,211
One of the patients was
asking for it earlier, so...

459
00:26:58,212 --> 00:26:59,412
Yes, well, our patient needs her rest.

460
00:26:59,413 --> 00:27:01,081
You can give it to Spencer tomorrow.

461
00:27:03,284 --> 00:27:04,851
I'm off tomorrow.

462
00:27:04,852 --> 00:27:06,252
All right, then I'll
give it to her for you.

463
00:27:09,256 --> 00:27:13,893
We're not having the same
problem again, are we, Eddie?

464
00:27:13,894 --> 00:27:17,129
(Fair music playing)

465
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,514
Have you heard anything yet?

466
00:27:36,515 --> 00:27:37,983
Nope. (Phone rings)

467
00:27:37,984 --> 00:27:39,651
For all I know, he's already skipped town.

468
00:27:39,652 --> 00:27:40,719
Well, I spoke to my mom...

469
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,821
Hannah, it's not up to your mom

470
00:27:42,822 --> 00:27:46,123
or you, or me to dig him out of this.

471
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,758
Is this everything?

472
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:49,760
Yeah, almost. Just to find my English book.

473
00:27:49,761 --> 00:27:51,495
All right, I'll be out front.

474
00:27:53,498 --> 00:27:56,466
(Door bell rings)

475
00:27:58,503 --> 00:28:00,004
Jamie: Hey.

476
00:28:00,005 --> 00:28:02,338
I was on my way to your place,
and I saw your car out front.

477
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:03,740
Where were you?

478
00:28:03,741 --> 00:28:06,342
Oh, making phone calls... hey.

479
00:28:06,343 --> 00:28:07,644
Was trying to track
down a guy who helped me

480
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,847
with the dry wall. And
see if he can help...

481
00:28:10,848 --> 00:28:13,482
Help with what? Back up your story?

482
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,416
What's his cut?

483
00:28:15,853 --> 00:28:17,185
What?

484
00:28:17,186 --> 00:28:19,254
Caleb, don't do this right now.

485
00:28:19,255 --> 00:28:20,255
Hey, you should listen to your girlfriend.

486
00:28:20,256 --> 00:28:21,690
I am.

487
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:23,692
And I believe her when she
says this isn't the first time

488
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:25,160
that you've stolen from that church.

489
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,928
What are we talking about here?

490
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:29,765
We aren't talking. We are done.

491
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:31,667
Last night, you were my defender.

492
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,467
- What happened?
- I woke up,

493
00:28:33,468 --> 00:28:36,270
and I realized that this isn't the
first time that you've screwed me over.

494
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:38,205
Oh, I see.

495
00:28:38,206 --> 00:28:40,606
I'm still that person, huh?

496
00:28:40,607 --> 00:28:42,542
Somehow you managed to
forgive your mother's sins.

497
00:28:42,543 --> 00:28:45,178
Don't suppose it's got anything
to do with that fancy car

498
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:46,312
she tossed at you.

499
00:28:46,313 --> 00:28:48,782
That has nothing to do with this.

500
00:28:48,783 --> 00:28:52,218
Maybe not, but it's got to
be easier to point a finger

501
00:28:52,219 --> 00:28:56,055
at someone with a rusty pick-up
and no permanent address.

502
00:28:56,056 --> 00:28:57,422
Isn't that all the proof you needed?

503
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:02,027
All the proof that I needed
were the ratty hand-me-downs

504
00:29:02,028 --> 00:29:03,195
that I had as a kid.

505
00:29:03,196 --> 00:29:05,664
Remember the winter coat
that ended at my elbow?

506
00:29:05,665 --> 00:29:07,465
And the unsigned permission slips?

507
00:29:07,466 --> 00:29:10,135
And the social workers,
and the foster families

508
00:29:10,136 --> 00:29:13,271
who slammed doors in my face when
they were tired of looking at me?

509
00:29:13,272 --> 00:29:15,006
That is my proof!

510
00:29:19,212 --> 00:29:22,146
Yeah.

511
00:29:22,147 --> 00:29:26,150
Wow, when you put it that way...

512
00:29:26,151 --> 00:29:28,419
I guess I wouldn't believe me, either.

513
00:29:38,162 --> 00:29:39,396
<i>Aria: Should I call the police?</i>

514
00:29:39,397 --> 00:29:40,897
<i>Emily: Yes. Wait.</i>

515
00:29:40,898 --> 00:29:42,499
<i>Unless you think it will make it worse.</i>

516
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,167
What's worse? "A's" got Ezra's kid.

517
00:29:45,168 --> 00:29:47,503
<i>I'm just saying, you saw
them, Malcolm wasn't hurt.</i>

518
00:29:47,504 --> 00:29:49,239
<i>But if you call the cops, "A" might...</i>

519
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,640
Don't. Just don't.

520
00:29:50,641 --> 00:29:52,609
Okay, I swear, if something
happens to that little boy

521
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:54,176
because of me, I don't
know what I'm going to do.

522
00:29:54,177 --> 00:29:56,312
<i>Aria. Walk over to the police station,</i>

523
00:29:56,313 --> 00:29:58,615
<i>and report it. I'll meet you there in ten.</i>

524
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,183
(Sighs)

525
00:30:24,444 --> 00:30:25,911
Malcolm?

526
00:30:25,912 --> 00:30:29,214
There's gonna be another
show. The man outside said so.

527
00:30:29,215 --> 00:30:30,649
I'm early.

528
00:30:41,594 --> 00:30:44,328
You know, I was supposed to pick
you up from your karate class, right?

529
00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:46,531
But your friend picked me up instead.

530
00:30:46,532 --> 00:30:48,332
She said her name was Alison.

531
00:30:53,838 --> 00:30:54,738
Come on, we should go.

532
00:30:56,107 --> 00:30:57,641
Your dad's probably wondering where we are.

533
00:31:15,714 --> 00:31:17,782
(Phone ringing)

534
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:21,183
_

535
00:31:22,154 --> 00:31:24,055
Emily?

536
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:27,158
Um, mom, I figured you'd be home by now.

537
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:29,427
I thought I was clear this morning.

538
00:31:29,428 --> 00:31:31,595
Look, I know you want answers,
but you can't be doing this.

539
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:36,267
Go home. We'll talk about this later.

540
00:31:36,268 --> 00:31:38,169
What's going on?

541
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,136
This is not the time.

542
00:31:39,137 --> 00:31:40,171
Why are they making you stay late?

543
00:31:40,172 --> 00:31:41,939
Emily, go.

544
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,441
I'll call you when I'm on my way.

545
00:32:11,301 --> 00:32:14,803
One, two, three, four...

546
00:32:33,121 --> 00:32:35,522
(Humming coming from the distance)

547
00:32:44,565 --> 00:32:47,167
(Humming continues)

548
00:32:58,345 --> 00:33:01,280
(Humming getting louder)

549
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:12,890
Didn't your mother have this?

550
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,493
Your mother.

551
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,962
Really, I must have left it at your house

552
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:19,564
and didn't get it back.

553
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:22,266
I left a lot of stuff there.

554
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:25,902
Is it just me, or was sixth
grade the best year ever?

555
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,173
I didn't even know you then.

556
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,274
Oh, honey,

557
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:32,776
you didn't even know me when you knew me.

558
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:36,479
(Music starts playing)

559
00:33:38,248 --> 00:33:40,149
Come on, give it up, Spence.

560
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,250
Let's pretend that you're getting ready for

561
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:43,752
your first boy-girl dance party.

562
00:33:47,057 --> 00:33:48,991
No one ever tells you that the practice

563
00:33:48,992 --> 00:33:51,427
is so much more fun than the real thing.

564
00:33:52,495 --> 00:33:55,197
Spencer: Was it Toby?

565
00:33:55,198 --> 00:33:59,467
Was he the one that
gave you that bloody lip?

566
00:33:59,468 --> 00:34:01,903
Toby?

567
00:34:01,904 --> 00:34:03,938
Oh, sweetie,

568
00:34:03,939 --> 00:34:06,441
girls fight much dirtier than boys.

569
00:34:08,077 --> 00:34:10,811
I'm lucky she didn't leave a scar.

570
00:34:10,812 --> 00:34:14,981
She? Who?

571
00:34:14,982 --> 00:34:16,750
You stopped dancing.

572
00:34:16,751 --> 00:34:18,619
I don't... I don't want to dance.

573
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,053
I'll change the song.

574
00:34:20,054 --> 00:34:23,324
No, I can't. I haven't slept in three days.

575
00:34:23,325 --> 00:34:26,693
Come on. I'm looking for something.

576
00:34:26,694 --> 00:34:29,295
The star on Mona's game board.

577
00:34:29,296 --> 00:34:32,398
Oh, that. It's in there.

578
00:34:36,069 --> 00:34:39,339
♪

579
00:35:19,009 --> 00:35:20,877
Wren: Spencer.

580
00:35:20,878 --> 00:35:22,411
What are you doing?

581
00:35:25,816 --> 00:35:27,750
♪

582
00:35:46,502 --> 00:35:48,970
So...

583
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:52,206
You're Malcolm's new hero.

584
00:35:52,207 --> 00:35:54,108
He had a blast tonight.

585
00:35:56,611 --> 00:35:57,778
What did he say?

586
00:35:57,779 --> 00:36:00,314
Ah, not much. Maggie said he

587
00:36:00,315 --> 00:36:02,549
mumbled something about puppets,

588
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,351
and then fell right to sleep.

589
00:36:05,787 --> 00:36:07,453
Huh.

590
00:36:07,454 --> 00:36:11,390
Oh, she asked me to pass along her thanks.

591
00:36:11,391 --> 00:36:12,758
You know, if you keep
spoiling him like this,

592
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:14,861
he's not going to want
to go with anyone else.

593
00:36:14,862 --> 00:36:15,929
Ezra?

594
00:36:17,164 --> 00:36:20,099
I don't think that I can do this anymore.

595
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,734
Aria, I was kidding. You won't have to.

596
00:36:22,735 --> 00:36:28,673
<i>No, I'm saying I don't think
that I can do this anymore.</i>

597
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,046
What? What do you mean?

598
00:36:34,047 --> 00:36:35,480
It isn't just the two of us now,

599
00:36:35,481 --> 00:36:37,415
and eventually somebody's
going to wind up hurt.

600
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:41,452
And I'd rather it be me.

601
00:36:42,921 --> 00:36:44,989
I just need to go home.

602
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:48,559
- Now? Okay, well then, just
let me get a waitress... - No.

603
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,263
You finish, I'm...

604
00:36:52,264 --> 00:36:54,364
I'm going to walk. I think that
the air will be good for me.

605
00:36:54,365 --> 00:36:57,868
Hey. I've had these days.

606
00:36:57,869 --> 00:37:00,636
I promise you things will
look different in the morning.

607
00:37:24,794 --> 00:37:27,496
Spencer: How many times did she visit her?

608
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:29,163
What is that?

609
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,433
Mona kept souvenirs.

610
00:37:31,434 --> 00:37:33,167
How many times did Cece visit her?

611
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:36,671
- I wouldn't know.
- Yes, you would, Wren.

612
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:38,774
You authorized it.

613
00:37:38,775 --> 00:37:40,509
And I was almost suspended for it.

614
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:44,211
Mona was under restriction
at that time, no visitors.

615
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:46,747
And you broke the rules for her because...?

616
00:37:53,922 --> 00:37:57,758
Cece called me and was
desperate to see her.

617
00:37:57,759 --> 00:37:58,925
She thought she could help her.

618
00:37:58,926 --> 00:38:00,927
Help her with what?

619
00:38:00,928 --> 00:38:02,061
Recover from the psychic
wounds inflicted by your

620
00:38:02,062 --> 00:38:03,596
late friend, Alison.

621
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:04,831
You sure it wasn't the other way around?

622
00:38:04,832 --> 00:38:07,099
Quite sure. Alison pulled
some stunt at a frat party

623
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,035
that got Cece kicked out of university.

624
00:38:10,971 --> 00:38:14,273
Ali... got Cece kicked out of school?

625
00:38:14,274 --> 00:38:15,741
Yeah, Cece came out the other side,

626
00:38:15,742 --> 00:38:19,378
and she thought she could
serve as a role model for Mona.

627
00:38:19,379 --> 00:38:21,513
And I agreed.

628
00:38:21,514 --> 00:38:23,816
How did she even know
that Mona was even in here?

629
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:27,353
Melissa called her.

630
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,489
(Knock on door)

631
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:35,360
Emily? Is Hannah home?

632
00:38:35,361 --> 00:38:37,662
No. She's out with Caleb, why?

633
00:38:40,066 --> 00:38:41,366
Mom?

634
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:43,301
What's going on?

635
00:38:43,302 --> 00:38:45,736
Why were you carrying
that missing persons file?

636
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:50,640
I promised I wouldn't
keep anything from you.

637
00:38:50,641 --> 00:38:54,178
But I have to make sure that
you keep this from your friends.

638
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,014
Can I have your phone, please?

639
00:38:58,383 --> 00:38:59,450
What?

640
00:38:59,451 --> 00:39:00,884
This is very sensitive information,

641
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:02,919
- if it got out before the police...
- Mom.

642
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,520
Please, what is it?

643
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:11,394
They found another body early this evening.

644
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,731
A young man.

645
00:39:15,732 --> 00:39:18,301
Late teens, early 20s.

646
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:19,767
No identification.

647
00:39:21,804 --> 00:39:24,539
What are you saying?

648
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,508
It could be Toby?

649
00:39:26,509 --> 00:39:28,377
I don't know.

650
00:39:28,378 --> 00:39:30,512
How can they not know?

651
00:39:30,513 --> 00:39:33,548
There was significant
trauma to the body, Emily.

652
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:38,552
It's gonna take some time
before they're certain.

653
00:39:40,922 --> 00:39:43,124
We'll know more tomorrow morning.

654
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,740
Do you want to take a walk or something?

655
00:40:17,045 --> 00:40:19,413
It was stupid.

656
00:40:19,414 --> 00:40:22,349
You gave someone a second chance.

657
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,251
That's never stupid.

658
00:40:24,252 --> 00:40:28,354
We talked about this road
trip we were gonna take.

659
00:40:28,355 --> 00:40:30,156
Ride bikes, go out west.

660
00:40:30,157 --> 00:40:33,393
(Sighing)

661
00:40:33,394 --> 00:40:35,195
I was already mapping it out.

662
00:40:37,498 --> 00:40:39,632
We can take a trip sometime.

663
00:40:39,633 --> 00:40:43,469
- I know it's not the same,
but... - It would be better.

664
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:46,138
Because I'll be with someone
who I know is looking out for me.

665
00:40:55,815 --> 00:40:58,049
I'll get us refills.

666
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:09,427
(Bell tolling)

667
00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:11,562
(Phone ringing)

668
00:41:13,532 --> 00:41:15,698
(Bell continues tolling)

669
00:41:30,147 --> 00:41:35,984
So, basically "A" was framing
Jamie the whole time?

670
00:41:35,985 --> 00:41:37,853
Do you think that bill from
the collection box was...

671
00:41:37,854 --> 00:41:39,955
Don't you?

672
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:42,591
Caleb is never going to forgive me.

673
00:41:42,592 --> 00:41:44,160
Where is he now?

674
00:41:44,161 --> 00:41:45,761
He went to go find Jamie.

675
00:41:45,762 --> 00:41:47,863
But even if he does, what
is he supposed to tell him?

676
00:41:47,864 --> 00:41:51,366
He may just have to find a
way to tell him the truth.

677
00:41:52,601 --> 00:41:54,870
Caleb's familiar with the workings of "A."

678
00:41:54,871 --> 00:41:56,204
So is Ezra.

679
00:41:56,205 --> 00:41:57,639
Do you plan on telling
him who bought his kid

680
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,941
a big, fat balloon today?

681
00:41:59,942 --> 00:42:01,643
(Knock on door)

682
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,745
Aria: Em? It was the wrong body.

683
00:42:04,746 --> 00:42:05,813
Hannah: What?

684
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:06,814
The John Doe, the one in the mask.

685
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,115
It was the wrong one.

686
00:42:08,116 --> 00:42:09,550
Emily, you're not making sense.

687
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:11,385
They just found a body tonight.

688
00:42:11,386 --> 00:42:12,753
In a shallow grave out in the woods.

689
00:42:12,754 --> 00:42:13,754
Where?

690
00:42:13,755 --> 00:42:15,389
Exactly where Spencer said it was.

691
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,824
They found her purse close by.

692
00:42:56,562 --> 00:42:58,196
<i>Mona's voice: Look at
all that's happened since</i>

693
00:42:58,197 --> 00:43:01,565
<i>you turned me down on our
little drive up the mountain.</i>

694
00:43:01,566 --> 00:43:03,201
<i>But I believe in second chances.</i>

695
00:43:03,202 --> 00:43:05,136
<i>Spencer's voice: You don't
have to ask me again, Mona.</i>

696
00:43:05,137 --> 00:43:07,371
<i>I'm in.</i>

697
00:43:36,141 --> 00:43:41,141
